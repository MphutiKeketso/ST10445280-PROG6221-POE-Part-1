1. Phishing Emails – Fake messages with infected attachments/links.  
2. Malicious Websites – Drive-by downloads from hacked sites.  
3. USB/Removable Media – Infected files transferred via external drives.  
4. Software Vulnerabilities – Exploiting unpatched system flaws.  
5. Pirated Software/Cracks – Malware disguised as "free" downloads.
