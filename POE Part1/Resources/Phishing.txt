 What is Phishing?  
Phishing is a cyberattack where criminals impersonate trusted entities (like banks, companies, or colleagues) to trick victims into revealing sensitive information (passwords, credit card numbers) or downloading malware. Itâ€™s one of the most common and dangerous forms of social engineering.

 How Phishing Works  
1. The Bait â€“ Attackers send fake emails, texts (smishing), or calls (vishing), pretending to be legitimate.  
2. The Hook â€“ The message creates urgency (e.g., "Your account is locked!") or offers fake rewards.  
3. The Catch â€“ Victims click malicious links, enter credentials on fake sites, or download infected files.

 Red Flags of a Phishing Attempt  
ðŸš© Urgent or threatening language ("Act now or your account will be closed!").  
ðŸš© Generic greetings ("Dear Customer" instead of your name).  
ðŸš© Mismatched URLs (Hover over links to see the real destination).  
ðŸš© Poor spelling/grammar (Legitimate companies rarely make mistakes).  
ðŸš© Unusual sender email (e.g., "support@amaz0n.net" instead of "@amazon.com").  
ðŸš© Requests for sensitive info (Banks never ask for passwords via email).

 How to Protect Yourself  
âœ… Verify the sender â€“ Check email addresses and phone numbers.  
âœ… Donâ€™t click links â€“ Manually type websites into your browser.  
âœ… Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) â€“ Even if hackers get your password, they canâ€™t log in.  
âœ… Install anti-phishing tools â€“ Browser extensions like Avast Online Security or Netcraft.  
âœ… Report phishing â€“ Forward scam emails to your IT team or [report@phishing.gov](mailto:report@phishing.gov).
