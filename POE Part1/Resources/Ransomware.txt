 What is Ransomware?  
Ransomware is a type of malicious software (malware) that encrypts files or locks devices and demands payment (a "ransom") to restore access. Victims are typically given a deadline, and if they don’t pay, their data may be deleted or leaked.

 How Ransomware Works  
1. Infection – Delivered via phishing emails, malicious downloads, or hacked networks.  
2. Encryption – Scrambles files (documents, photos, databases) so they’re unusable.  
3. Ransom Note – Displays instructions for payment (usually in cryptocurrency like Bitcoin).  
4. Extortion – Attackers may threaten to leak data if unpaid (double extortion).

 Types of Ransomware  
| Type                           | Description                                                     | Example                                     |  
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|  
| Encrypting Ransomware          | Locks files with strong encryption (AES-256).                   | WannaCry, REvil                             |  
| Locker Ransomware              | Blocks access to the entire device (but doesn’t encrypt files). | Police-themed ransomware                    |  
| Doxware/Leakware               | Threatens to publish stolen data if unpaid.                     | Maze, Conti                                 |  
| RaaS (Ransomware-as-a-Service) | Hackers rent ransomware tools to others.                        | DarkSide (used in Colonial Pipeline attack) |

 Famous Ransomware Attacks  
- WannaCry (2017) – Spread via Windows, hit 200,000+ systems globally (hospitals, banks).  
- Colonial Pipeline (2021) – Forced a major US fuel pipeline to pay $4.4 million in Bitcoin.  
- Kaseya (2021) – Targeted IT firms, affecting 1,500+ businesses through a software update.

 How Ransomware Spreads  
- Phishing Emails – Fake invoices or shipping notices with infected attachments.  
- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) Attacks – Exploits weak passwords on remote systems.  
- Software Vulnerabilities – Unpatched apps/systems (e.g., EternalBlue exploit).  
- Malvertising – Infected ads on legitimate websites.  
- USB Drives – Auto-run malware when plugged in.

 Signs of a Ransomware Attack  
⚠ Files renamed with strange extensions (e.g., `.locked`, `.crypt`).  
⚠ Ransom note (usually a `.txt` or pop-up with payment demands).  
⚠ Slow system performance as files are encrypted.  
⚠ Unable to open documents, databases, or applications.

 What to Do If Infected  
1. Isolate the Device – Disconnect from Wi-Fi/networks to prevent spread.  
2. Do NOT pay the Ransom – No guarantee files will be restored, and it funds criminals.  
3. Report to Authorities – Contact the FBI (US) or local cybercrime units.  
4. Restore from Backups – Use clean, offline backups to recover data.  
5. Scan for Malware – Use tools like Kaspersky Rescue Disk to remove infection.

 How to Prevent Ransomware  
✅ Backup Regularly – Follow the 3-2-1 rule (3 copies, 2 media types, 1 offsite).  
✅ Update Software – Patch OS, browsers, and plugins (ransomware exploits old networks).  
✅ Use Antivirus & Firewalls – Tools like Bitdefender or CrowdStrike can block ransomware.  
✅ Train Employees – Teach them to spot phishing emails.  
✅ Disable Macros & RDP – If unused, turn off remote desktop access.  
✅ Enable Application Whitelisting – Only allow trusted programs to run.

 Ransomware vs. Malware vs. Phishing  
| Ransomware                | Malware                              | Phishing                         |  
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|  
| Encrypts files for ransom | Umbrella term for malicious software | Tricks users into revealing data |  
| Example: LockBit          | Example: Viruses, spyware            | Example: Fake bank emails        |

 Should You Pay the Ransom?  
❌ No! Law enforcement advises against it because:  
- No guarantee you’ll get files back.  
- Funds criminal activity, leading to more attacks.  
- You may be targeted again (marked as a "payer").  

Instead, focus on prevention and backups.
