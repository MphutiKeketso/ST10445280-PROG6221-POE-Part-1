 What Are Firewalls in Cybersecurity?  üî•üõ°Ô∏è
A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined security rules. It acts as a barrier between trusted internal networks (e.g., your home or company network) and untrusted external networks (e.g., the Internet) to block malicious traffic.

 Purpose of Firewalls  
1. Blocks Unauthorized Access  
   - Prevents hackers, malware, and cyberattacks from entering a network.  

2. Filter Traffic  
   - Allows or denies data packets based on security rules (e.g., blocking suspicious IP addresses).  

3. Prevents Data Breaches  
   - Stops attackers from stealing sensitive information.  

4. Controls Network Traffic  
   - Restricts access to certain websites or services (e.g., blocking social media at work).  

5. Logs & Monitors Activity  
   - Keeps records of traffic for security analysis and threat detection.

 Types of Firewalls  
| Type                               | How It Works                                                     | Best For                              |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Packet-Filtering Firewall          | Checks data packets (source/destination IP, port) against rules. | Basic security, small networks        |
| Stateful Inspection Firewall       | Tracks active connections and allows only trusted traffic.       | Medium to large businesses            |
| Proxy Firewall (Application-Level) | Acts as an intermediary between users and the internet.          | Web security, deep traffic inspection |
| Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)    | Combines traditional firewall + IPS, malware detection, & AI.    | Advanced threat protection            |
| Cloud Firewall                     | Hosted in the cloud to protect cloud-based systems.              | SaaS, cloud infrastructure            |

 How Firewalls Work  
1. Incoming/Outgoing Traffic ‚Üí Reaches the firewall.  
2. Rule Check ‚Üí Firewall compares traffic against security policies.  
3. Action Taken ‚Üí Allows safe traffic / Blocks malicious traffic.  
4. Logs Activity ‚Üí Records events for security analysis.  

Example: 
- A hacker tries to access a company‚Äôs server via Port 22 (SSH).  
- The firewall blocks the request because it‚Äôs not from a trusted IP.

 Firewall vs. Antivirus  
| Firewall                                   | Antivirus                          |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Blocks external threats (hackers, malware) | Detects & removes internal malware |
| Network-level protection                   | File/system-level protection       |
| Prevents unauthorized access               | Cleans infected files              |

Best Practice: Use both for maximum security.

 Limitations of Firewalls  
‚ùå Cannot stop internal threats (e.g., a malicious employee).  
‚ùå Doesn‚Äôt protect against social engineering (e.g., phishing).  
‚ùå Needs regular updates to stay effective against new threats.
