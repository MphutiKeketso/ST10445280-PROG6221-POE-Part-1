What is Antivirus Software?  
Antivirus software is a cybersecurity program designed to **detect, prevent, and remove malicious software (malware) from computers, smartphones, and other devices. It acts as a digital "immune system," scanning files, emails, and web traffic to block threats like viruses, ransomware, spyware, and trojans.  



Key Functions of Antivirus Software  
1. Real-Time Scanning  
   - Continuously monitors system activity to block malware before execution.  

2. Malware Detection & Removal  
   - It identifies and deletes viruses, worms, trojans, spyware, and ransomware.  

3. Heuristic Analysis  
   - It detects new, unknown threats by analysing suspicious behaviour (not just known malware signatures).  

4. Email & Web Protection  
   - Scans email attachments and blocks malicious websites (anti-phishing).  

5. Firewall Integration
   - Some antivirus programs include a firewall for extra network security.  

6. Automatic Updates  
   - Regularly updates virus definitions to combat emerging threats.  



How Antivirus Software Works  
1. Signature-Based Detection  
   - Compares files against a database of known malware signatures  
   - (Example: Detecting the "WannaCry" ransomware by its code pattern.) 

2. Behavioural Analysis  
   - Flags programs acting suspiciously (e.g., encrypting files rapidly like ransomware).  

3. Sandboxing  
   - Run suspicious files in an **isolated virtual environment to check for malicious behaviour.  

4. Machine Learning & AI  
   - Advanced antivirus uses AI to predict and block zero-day exploits.

Types of Antivirus Solutions  
|   Type                  |   Description                                          |   Best For                           |  
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|  
|   Free Antivirus        | Basic malware protection (e.g., Avast Free, AVG)       | Home users on a budget               |  
|   Premium Antivirus     | Advanced features (firewall, VPN, phishing protection) | Businesses & privacy-conscious users |  
|   Cloud-Based AV        | Scans files online, reducing system load               | Lightweight devices                  |  
|   Enterprise AV         | Centralized management for large networks              | Corporations, IT admins              |

 Why is Antivirus Important  
‚úî Prevents Data Theft (e.g., keyloggers stealing passwords).  
‚úî Blocks Ransomware (e.g., attacks that encrypt files for ransom).  
‚úî Stops Spyware (e.g., malware tracking your browsing habits).  
‚úî Protects Against Zero-Day Exploits (new, unpatched vulnerabilities).  

---

 Limitations of Antivirus  
‚ùå Cannot stop all threats (e.g., sophisticated APTs or social engineering).  
‚ùå May slow down systems (resource-heavy scans).  
‚ùå Requires updates (outdated antivirus fails against new malware).

 Antivirus vs. Firewall  
|   Antivirus                        |   Firewall                           |  
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|  
| Scans files & programs for malware | Blocks unauthorized network traffic  |  
| Protects against internal threats  | Protects against external intrusions |  
| Example: Norton, McAfee            | Example: Windows Defender Firewall   |  

üëâ Best Practice: Use both for layered security!

 How to Stay Protected  
‚úÖ Install reputable antivirus software and keep it updated.  
‚úÖ Enable real-time scanning  
‚úÖ Avoid pirated software (common malware source).  
‚úÖ Use a firewall + antivirus combo.  
‚úÖ Educate yourself on phishing scams (Antivirus can‚Äôt stop you from clicking malicious links!).
